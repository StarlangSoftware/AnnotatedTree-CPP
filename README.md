# AnnotatedTree

A treebank is a corpus where the sentences in each language are syntactically (if necessary morphologically) annotated. In the  treebanks, the syntactic annotation usually follows constituent and/or dependency structure.

Treebanks annotated for the syntactic or semantic structures of the sentences are essential for developing state-of-the-art statistical natural language processing (NLP) systems including part-of-speech-taggers, syntactic parsers, and machine translation systems. There are two main groups of syntactic treebanks, namely treebanks annotated for constituency (phrase structure) and the ones that are annotated for dependency structure.
